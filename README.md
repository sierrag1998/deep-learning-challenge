# Unit 21 Homework: Charity Funding Predictor

## About the Repository 
Included in this repository are 4 jupyter notebook. The original model is built in Starter_Code.ipynb. There are 3 attempts at optimizing the model included in Optimization_One.ipynb, Optimization_Two.ipynb, and Optimization_Three.ipynb.

The saved HDF5 files from each notebook are included in the Saved Model Folder. The original data set is included in the Resources Folder. The report on the assignment is included in the Optimizing Alphabet Soup PDF, and the rubric is included in the Module 21 PDF for ease of access. 


## About the Assignment 

Using the data set given, I created a binary classifier model that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.



### Step 1: Preprocess the Data


### Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model


### Step 3: Optimize the Model


### Step 4:  Report on the Neural Network Model
